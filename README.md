<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
üìù The scope of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the new positions of soccer players based on the changes in their performance over time.
[![Product Name Screen Shot][about]](https://fastapi-xv4sablhwq-uc.a.run.app/about.html)


üìù This GitHub repository contains all the tried and tested multi-class modeling operations and benchmarks.

üåê The interface created for FastAPI after the decided model is as follows, you can click on the image to access model interface.

## Methodogy

[![Product Name Screen Shot][methodogy]]

üîç Player data from the Fifa 24 site was obtained through the selenium library using web scraping methods. The obtained data was stored in Google Cloud Big Query and then imported to jupyternotebook. After the necessary pre-processing on the data, visualization analysis was performed with PowerBi. After deciding on the most appropriate method as a result of the work done in Jupyter Notebooks, the FastApi deployment of the model was realized and deployed to Google Cloud for the application url.

## Project's Pipeline

[![Product Name Screen Shot][pipeline]]

üìùIn Workflow Pipelines, you can see a more detailed version of the processes. This repository covers up to the "Explainable AI" section in the image above. To access and view the codes of the stages after these steps, you can go to <a href="https://github.com/gozdecerenyildiz/Predict_Modelling_EndtoEnd_Project">this project's Api codes and CI/CD Process(End to End Project)</a>




## DashBoard and PowerBi Vizulations
